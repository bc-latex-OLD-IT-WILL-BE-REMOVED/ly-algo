What about this package  ?
==========================

**ly-algo**, which is a contraction of **ly-c√©e** and **algo-rithm**, has been built to allow the writings of pretty algorithms and verbatim contents.

Only one french documentation is proposed but it contains a lot of examples of use : see the PDF file named `lyalgo-doc[fr].pdf` inside the folder `lyalgo`.

The only thing needed to use is the standalone package ``lyalgo.sty`` inside the folder `lyalgo`.


I beg your pardon for my english...
===================================

English is not my native language, so be nice if you notice misunderstandings, misspellings or grammatical errors in my documents and my codes.


What about this first version `0.0.0-beta` ?
============================================
