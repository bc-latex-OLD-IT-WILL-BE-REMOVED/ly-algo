**Tools to work with lists have been added:** here are all the new features.

    1) The macro ``\List`` is for writing lists by giving their content.

    2) `\ListElt` prints symbolically the k-th elements of a named list.

    3) ``\ListUntil`` and ``\ListFrom`` are to indicated some special sub lists extracted from a list.

    4) The macro `\AddList` is a math binary operator for the concatenation of lists.

    5) The macro `\Len` is a math function to use to indicate the length of  a list.

    6) ``\Append``, ``\Append*`` and ``\Append**`` can be used to indicate that an element is appended to a list.

    7) ``\Prepend``, ``\Prepend*`` and ``\Prepend**`` can be used to indicate that an element is prepended to a list.

    9) ``\PopAt``, ``\PopAt*`` and ``\PopAt**`` can be used to indicate that the k-th element is popped from a list.

    9) ``\KeepL``, ``\KeepR`` and ``\KeepLR`` can be used to indicate that the first, last or "between" elements are popped from a list.
